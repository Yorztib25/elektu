# ***Elektu!***

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a347df6ff17042e498bff84943777216)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/jbellue/elektu?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=jbellue/elektu&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

[A small page to help select people from a group](https://jbellue.github.io/elektu/)

Open source, no-app-needed clone of [the excellent app Chwazi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tendadigital.chwaziApp&hl=en)

## If the app's so good, why a clone?

* I wanted the possibility to give a random number to each person
* I was bored
* No need to install anything, that's better, probably?
* 0% tracking (I'm not implying chwazi does anything naughty. But here I know nothing evil goes on). The only thing there is a user counter available at [goatcounter](https://elektu.goatcounter.com/).
* why not?

## The name

*Elektu* means "choose" in [esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto). Note, I don't speak esperanto, so maybe the name's dead wrong. But I still like it.

    1. Choose the number of people to be selected in the top right menu
    2. Have everyone touch the screen.
    3. The number of people selected in the menu will be selected from the group.

   You need at least the amount of people touching the screen that you want teams...
